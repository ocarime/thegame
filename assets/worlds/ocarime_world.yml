      - Hi!
      - As audio designer I mostly work on game music , sound design and audio implementation and film music and sound design. What I find most important when working together with other media is making the result feel whole, which is why I try to be as adaptable as possible.
      - As audio programmer, I work on projects such as audio-plugins , standalone applications and other programs and algorithms. I also create systems for and implement game audio . For audio I mainly use C++ and for game audio implementation I mainly use C# , but I am also experienced with other languages.

      - Hi, I'm Danae! I am specialized in the integration of music and technology.
      - I'm fascinated by musical storytelling in a fantastical and whimsical setting, which I apply in autonomous compositions, games and interactive media. Moreover I have a broad knowledge of software and coding skills to implement music and audio in any interactive project.

      - Hi! I am Bastiaan van Bentum and I am a part of Ocarime.
      - I was just starting to work at a new instrument sound for a new game soundtrack that is in the making. I love to use my voice as a starting point for all sorts of different interesting sounds. I sing or hum a melody and than I process this with intricate combinations of effects to make it sound like a brass or string instrument. The fact that the human voice is such a flexible instrument on itself makes the outcome always surprising and different.
      - I work mostly as a composer for games. Games give me a lot of joy because they can give me the feeling my music and sound design are a part of a living breathin world for someone to get lost in.
      - Have a listen to one voice brass and string effect music pieces and other music I am proud of! You can find the music in my room.
      - Have a nice day!
      - Bastiaan

      - Waddup, I’m Thomas van Rossum and I’m a Composer / Sound Designer for games, and part of the Ocarime team!
      - This year I’ve been, and will be, exploring the potential of Virtual Reality game audio. I’ve been researching ways where both music and sound effects respond correctly to its environment through Binaural and Ambisonic audio. I love the extra dimensions that VR has to offer for music and sound design, and the creative possibilities that come with it!
      - Keep being awesome,
      - Thomas

      - Hey you! I was expecting you!
      - Welcome to my room! I am Greg Candel, one of the sound designers of the Ocarime network. Can you hear the waves striking and the boat creaking? If you listen closely, there are many more elements there.
      - Oh how I love shaping worlds. To me, creating sounds is like dancing. Both move in a place through space and time with color, expression and emotion.
      - Don’t expect me to only make pretty things though. Smashing, slashing, impacts.. You could say I like my realism!
      - I like all of it. As long as I can shape a world.. Do you want to explore them with me? Look around you. They’re all there!

      - A traveler!
      - Greetings and welcome to my room.
      - My name is Amber Veerman and I am one of the members of Ocarime. Through years of training and practise I've reached the high rank of Media Composer, but I can tell that you didn't come here by accident.
      - As you might or might not know.. The enemy is upon us, traveler.
      - Sadly I can't sell you any potions for the upcoming battle. My potions are too strong for-..
      - Right, wrong meme.
      - But! I can offer you something better. See me as your fifer, bugler or drummer at the battlefield or the bard that sings great tales about your heroic stories at a tavern.
      - Your composer for your game or screenplay.
      - If I piqued your interest, traveler, then please look into a few of my victories. Grand artists have portrayed a few of them as paintings that I keep in my room. Let me know if you have any questions or if you are in need of my service.
      - Good luck and stay safe.
